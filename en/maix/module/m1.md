## M1/M1W

Using Kendryte's AI chip [K210](https://kendryte.com/) as the core unit, K210 is fully pin-out, with strong performance, small size (`25.4*25.4mm`), low price (`<$8`), improve hardware design efficiency, reduce hardware design difficulty, and increase the anti-interference ability with shielded case

* M1: 8MB SRAM on chip, 16MB Flash built in module

* M1W: M1 based with WiFi (`esp8285`) module


## Features

* Dual-core 64-bit processor with hardware floating-point operation, up to 800MHz frequency (the highest supported frequency is based on the development board design)
* Built-in 8MB (6MB + 2MB) RAM
* 16MB Flash
* Commonly used peripherals such as I2C, SPI, I2S, WDT, TIMER, RTC, UART, GPIO, DVP, DMAC, etc.
* Unique programmable IO array (ie FPIOA, peripherals can be mapped to any pin) for more flexible product design
* Joint Test Working Group (JTAG)
* With machine vision capabilities
* With machine hearing and speech recognition, built-in voice processing unit (APU)
* With convolutional artificial neural network hardware accelerator KPU, high performance convolution artificial neural network operation
* Fast Fourier Transform Accelerator (FFT Accelerater)
* Hardware AES encryption and decryption
* Secure Hash Algorithm Accelerator SHA256
* Low voltage, lower power consumption than systems with the same processing power
* Support firmware encryption, difficult to crack using common methods
* 3.3V/1.8V dual voltage support, no level shifting, cost saving
* TSMC 28nm advanced process, temperature range -40 ° C to 125 ° C, stable and reliable
* Metal shield shell to enhance anti-interference ability
